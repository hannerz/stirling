Stirling Engine is a game development engine written in Python 3.2.  Written 
as a hobby by several geeks, it is intended to be a fully function engine for 
making text-based multiplayer roleplaying games (MMORPGs).  Currently we are in 
extremely early development, so would not recommend anyone using the project 
at this point.  If you're interested in learning more, check out the /docs 
directory for more information.

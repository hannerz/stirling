This is the first journal entry of hopefully many, while I try to outline and 
explain just how a group of relatively unskilled developers go from a bunch of 
half-formed ideas to a final product.  It should be noted that these journals 
are as much more for my own records and knowledge than to be taken as any sort 
of tutorial on how to do things.

Tonight should mark the release of v0.0.1, which is the first version in which 
anything can be done on the MUD.  Woot woot!
